			 * FlexFormFieldValues are stored as sheets, but we want the "merged" settings array

			 * Sheets make it impossible to have a flat settings array while also having multiple tabs in the backend form
			 * also causes issues when arrays are defined over multiple sheets, i.e. if we have a structure of settings.options.value2 in sheet1 and settings.options.value2 in sheet2, FlexFormFieldValues::get('settings.options') returns nothing because settings.options is defined in two sheets
			 * FlexFormService supports both convertFlexFormContentToArray and convertFlexFormContentToSheetsArray but for some reason the default for FlexFormFieldValues is to use sheets structure
			 * since all field value transformations for Records are based on TCA, maybe the 'flexform' type in TCA should have an option to decide between sheets or merged structure?
